# Random String Generator

_see it here_: https://mikeymanoguerra.github.io/random-string-generator/

## What is it? 

- Uses browser crypto API to generate a random string.
- The user can decide what combination of characters to use when generating the string.
- An optional delimeter can be added to the string, breaking hash into semiregular lengthed chunks seperated by chosen delimeter char.

## Other notes
- Uses vanilla js, html, and css only.
- minimal styling used as that was not the purpose of this exercise.
